# Capacitors

Capacitors are electrical components that can store and release electrical energy.

They do not generate energy like batteries, which produce electricity through chemical reactions. Capacitors only store the energy provided by an external source.

## How Capacitors Work
- Charging: When connected to an energy source, electrons accumulate on one plate, creating a potential difference between the two plates.
- Discharging: Once connected to a circuit, the capacitor releases its stored energy, allowing current to flow until the voltage between the plates is balanced or depleted.

### Voltage Limit
Capacitors have a maximum voltage limit (rated voltage). Exceeding this limit can cause damage or failure.

## Usage of Capacitors
- Smoothing Signals: Capacitors smooth out voltage fluctuations in power supply circuits by releasing stored energy during dips, helping maintain consistent voltage.
- High-Power Bursts: They can store significant power for short-term, high-energy needs, such as camera flashes.
- Backup Power: They provide temporary power to maintain functions during brief interruptions, though their capacity is much lower than batteries.
- Filtering: Capacitors filter out specific frequency ranges in audio circuits, acting as high-pass or low-pass filters.
- AC Coupling: Capacitors block DC and pass AC, which helps remove DC offsets and shift signal baselines.

## Types of Capacitors
- Ceramic Disc Capacitors: Small, high-frequency applications. common in timing and signal filtering. (Non Polarized)
- Poly Film Capacitors: Precise and stable, suitable for signal and timing circuits. (Non Polarized)
- Electrolytic Capacitors: Higher capacitance for power supply and energy storage applications. (Polarized, requires correct polarity)

## Unit of Measurement
The capacitance of a Capacitor is noted in farad (F), but it is typically too large for practical use. Capacitors are usually rated in microfarads (µF), nanofarads (nF), or picofarads (pF).

## How they are made
Capacitors consist of two conductive plates separated by an insulating dielectric material. The dielectric can be ceramic, plastic, air, or other substances, affecting the capacitor’s properties. 
Larger capacitors (e.g., electrolytic) often have rolled-up plates and dielectric, while smaller ones like ceramic capacitors are typically flat.

## Things I have learned
- Capacitors can store and release energy
- They consist of two conductive plates separated by a dieletric 
- When connected to power, one side is collecting electrons, when connected together the electrons travel to the other side
- They can be used to smooth signals or filter unwanted frequencies
- When too much voltage is applied they can have damage, this is called voltage limit
