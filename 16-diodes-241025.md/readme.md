# Diodes

A diode is an electronic component that lets electricity flow in one direction.

## How Diodes Are Made
A diode is made from silicon, a semiconductor material. Impurities are added to the silicon crystal (a process called doping) to create two types of semiconductor material:

- P-Type: Has “holes” or a lack of electrons, which gives it an overall positive charge.
- N-Type: Has excess electrons, giving it an overall negative charge.

A diode is formed by placing P-Type and N-Type materials together, creating what is known as a P-N junction. This P-N junction allows electrons to move in only one direction, controlling the flow of current.

## Where Diodes Are Used
- Protecting Circuits: Prevents damage if power is accidentally connected in reverse.
- AC to DC Conversion (Rectification): Converts alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC) by allowing current flow in only one direction.
- Signal Isolation: Blocks unwanted parts of a signal, ensuring it moves in one direction.

## Type of Diodes
- Signal Diodes: For low current
- Rectifier Diodes: For high current
- LED: Also called Light Emitting Diodes and they emitt light, when connected the right way
- Zener Diode: A Diode can only resist to an amount of voltage (Breakdown Voltage) until they break and let through. There ar special Diodes, called Zener Diodes, that have a low Breakdown Volatage but do not get destroyed when reached.

## What I have learned
- A diode is made by adding imurtites to a silicon crystal. This lets create P-Type and N-Type materials and the for a P-N-Junction, where electrons can onyl move in one direction
- You can use diodes to protect a circuit or convert AC to DC with a process called rectification
- A diode can only resist up to a certain voltage until it breaks, this is called breakdown voltage, and also has limits when connected the right way
