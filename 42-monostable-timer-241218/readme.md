# Monostable Timer

Building a timer circuit with the NE555 in monostable mode using different tools.

## Falstad (Circuit Js)
Having a way to see how current flows and what voltage is across different components helps a lot.
It is still different from a real circuit since the connections you draw here are very simple.

## Tinkercad
This is closer to building an actual circuit. 
However it is harder to debug when something is not working as expected.
But you still have some tools to help you with that.

## Breadboard
Building the circuit on a breadboard with real components is much more exciting.
First it did not work, then I rechecked all connections and it worked properly. 
Maybe jumper wires are not the best solution for this.

## Things I have learned

- Take your time to first understand the circuit using a simulator
- It is very important to build the circuit with real components
