# Approaches to Learn Electronics

This serves as a collection of things to help me rearrange.

Have noticed that it is not so engaging to just learn theory things without actually building stuff.

Since there are so many ressources I am a bit lost. There are some videos I could watch and books I can read. But I need to build real things. The thing is that arduino stuff focusses too much on the coding part. And the Modular Synth Stuff is too advanced for me currently. I think I need something in between. I need some sort of guide I can follow while learning and building stuff.

## Read books that you understand
While you have some books already, they currently are too advanced:
- Practical Electronics for Inventors, Paul Scherz
- The Art of Electronics, Paul Horowitz

Try to find books that are more on your level of experience:
- Getting Statred in Electronics, Forrest M. Mims
- Electronics All in One for Dummies, Doug Lowe
- Make: Electronics, Charles Platt
- Open Circits, Windell Oskay

## Try new YouTube Channels
- [The Learning Circuit](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwO8CTSLTkii9S_vhEOsyJ17RI3jjBZ95) seems to have a good amount of tutorials available
- [Khan Academy - Electrical Engineering](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSQl0a2vh4HCLqA-rhMi_Z_WnBkD3wUka)

## Learn about circuits by building them
The Channel [Learn Electronics](https://www.youtube.com/@learnelectronics) has a series on [Classic Circuits](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGhvWnPsCr5_n-9fFQM6Sa9BZir0wvm59) that I could watch an try to understand.

## Try Guided Course
- [Coursera - Fundamentals of Audio and Music Engineering](https://www.coursera.org/learn/audio-engineering)
- [edX - Circuits and Electronics 1: Basic Circuit Analysis](https://www.edx.org/learn/circuits/massachusetts-institute-of-technology-circuits-and-electronics-1-basic-circuit-analysis)

## Take industry knowledge as guide
The [Analog Devices Wiki](https://wiki.analog.com/university/courses/electronics/text/electronics-toc) seems quite comprehensive

## Build Modular Synth Kits
One approach could be to build modular synth kits and try to understand how they work.

- Erica Synth and Moritz Klein have teamed up to create [DIY Synth Modules](https://www.ericasynths.lv/shop/diy-kits-1/edu-diy-vco/) that also offer in depth explanations on how the circuits work, they also do provide the [EDU DIY Labor](https://www.ericasynths.lv/shop/diy-kits-1/edu-diy-labor/) which is prototyping station.
- Polykit Synth also offers DIY Modules in their [Store](https://store.polykit.rocks) that have some sort of instructions
- At [Exploding Shed](https://www.exploding-shed.com) you can get many DIY Synth Kits

### Getting into more complex synth projects
- There is [Music from outer space](https://musicfromouterspace.com) which covers a lot of diy synth topics.
- The author also has written the book Make: Synthesizers which could also be worth reading

## Things I have learned
- There is so much stuff out there that it can be quite intimidating
- It is important to reflect and adjust your approach
