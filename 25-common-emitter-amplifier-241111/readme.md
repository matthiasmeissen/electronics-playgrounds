# Common Emitter Amplifier

There is a simple circuit that uses an npn transistor to work as an amplifier.
Somehow the source and the emitter of the transistor share ground, this is why they are called common emitter amplifiers.
The class a common emitter configuration seems not to be the best, since it adds a bias to the signal.

## This topic is too advanced for me currently
Building an amplifier looks like to be a quite complex task.
Need to learn a lot to understand this.
In context to the stuff I already know, this topics is a bit too advanced.
Need to focus on the basics first to understand such things.
