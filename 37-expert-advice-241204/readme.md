## General Guidance

### Start Small and Simple:
- Focus on basic projects like volume knobs (voltage dividers), passive low-pass/high-pass filters, or basic oscillators.
- Learn by experimenting with circuit components (resistors, capacitors, and potentiometers).

### Spread Victories Evenly:
- Take small, manageable steps to stay motivated. 
- Build basic circuits, then incrementally add complexity, such as mixing oscillators or cascading them.

### Use Tools and Simulators:
- Utilize tools like Falstad's Circuit Simulator to visualize how electricity flows and predict circuit behavior.


## Recommended Projects and Platforms

### Logic Noise and Lunetta Synths:
- Start with the Logic Noise series on Hackaday to create sound-generating circuits with digital logic chips (e.g., CD40106).
- The Lunetta synth movement is great for exploring simple sound generation using digital chips.

### DIY Synth Kits:
- Erica Synths / Moritz Klein DIY Kits: Highly recommended for beginners with excellent supporting learning materials and video tutorials.
- Northcoast Synthesis Kits: Another great option with detailed learning resources.

### Daisy Seed: 
- Ideal for those interested in coding for embedded audio systems.
