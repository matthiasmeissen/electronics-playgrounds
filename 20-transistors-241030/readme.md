# Transistors

A transistor is an electronic component that functions as a switch or an amplifier.

## Types of Transistors
There are two main types of transistors:
- Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJT), which come in NPN and PNP (less common) configurations.
- Field Effect Transistors (FET), often chosen for their efficiency in power management.

## Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJT)

### Structure and Pins
Each BJT has three pins (EBC - Eat Better Cookies):

- Emitter (E): For an NPN transistor, usually connected to Ground.
- Base (B): The control pin, where a small current activates the transistor.
- Collector (C): Connected to the positive side of the circuit.

### Operating Regions
- Cutoff: No or minimal current at the Base; no current flows from Collector to Emitter (transistor is off).
- Active: Base current allows a controlled flow from Collector to Emitter (amplifying state).
- Saturation: Full current flows from Collector to Emitter (transistor is on).

### Switch or Amplifier
Depending on which region the transistor is in, it acts as a switch (cutoff and saturation regions) or as an amplifier (active region).

### Gain
Each transistor has a gain, which specifies how much it amplifies the Base current:

- In the active region, the gain determines how much Collector current (IC) flows for a given Base current (IB).
- In the saturation region, gain becomes less relevant, and the circuit itself limits the maximum current flow.

## Things I have learned
- A transistor can be used as a switch or amplifier
- This is acchieved by utilizing different regions, depending on the applied base current
- There are three pins Emitter, Base and Collector
- For an NPN Transistor the Emitter is connected to Ground
