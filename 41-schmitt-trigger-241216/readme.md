# Schmitt Trigger

The schmitt trigger is a simple circuit that creates a square wave signal.

## How it works

Has hysteresis with low and high threshold.

Used to convert noisy input into clean square waves.

A schmitt trigger can be built in deifferent ways:

- Many logic ICs have built in Schmitt Triggers
- Can be built with transistors
- Can be built with an op amp and comparator

## Simple Oscillator

You can use an inverting schmitt trigger with a resistor and a capacitor to create a simple osciallator.

The frequency can be set by changing the resistor or capacitor values.
