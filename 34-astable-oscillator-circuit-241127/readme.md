# Astable Oscialltor Circuit

Building a square wave generator with adjustable frequency using an astable osciallator circuit.

## NE555

The core of this circuit is an NE555 which is an integrated circuit that has three modes:

- Astable Mode (Oscillator Mode)
- Monostable Mode (Time Mode)
- Bistable Mode (Flip Flop Mode)

## Approach

This circuit is quite complex and I do not really know how it works. 
Maybe looking at it from different perspectives helps me understand it step by step.

## Things I found along the way

- [Every Circuit](https://everycircuit.com) is an tool to design, simulate and share circuits online
- [Oskitone](https://www.oskitone.com) has DIY electronic musical instruments and soldering kits

## Things I have learned
- It is ok to build a circuit without understanding how it works
- The inner workings of most circuits seem quite complex
